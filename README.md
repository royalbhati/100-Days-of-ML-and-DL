**Today's Progress** : I decided to work on a competition hosted on [Driven Data](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/) where we have to predict Dengue Spread 

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exiciting ,will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way .

**Conclusion** : Although I couldnt do very well in the competition but I learnt about new regression techniques called Poisson
              and Negative binomial.
